# Contributing

### Submitting PRs
1. Don't bump the version of the package in your PR - I'll do it myself :)
2. Please split up unrelated changes into different PRs, so that they can be
discussed independently.
3. Please follow the [Meteor style guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide) as much as possible.
4. Please rebase instead of merging. When submitting a PR, make sure you have rebased on master first.

### Planning
1. Feature discussions happen inside GitHub issues, or in Hackpads on meteor.hackpad.com if it is a big design.

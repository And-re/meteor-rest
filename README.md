# REST for Meteor

I'm working on a set of packages that will make it easy to create a REST API for your Meteor app.

## Completed

[simple:json-routes](https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-rest/tree/master/packages/json-routes) - the simplest way to define a server-side route in your Meteor app, with no external dependencies.

## In progress

simple:rest - automatically make your Meteor app accessible over HTTP and DDP alike.
